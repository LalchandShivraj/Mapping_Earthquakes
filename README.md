# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

Basil and Sadhana have seen the two different maps (street and satellite) and the earthquake overlay. They would now like to the earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates' location on the earth and also earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. 

Below is a list of deliverables:

1. Add Tectonic Plate Data.
2. Add Major Earthquake Data.
3. Add an additional Map.

## Software and Resources:

. VScode, Javascript, Leaflet.js and geoJSON data.

## Results

The three deliverables were done and tested. The colors were adjusted for earthquakes greater than 4.5 magnitudes.
Additionally, a third map was added as Light.

Screen shots of some of the results:

1. TectonicPLates_with_Popup.png
2. Major_Earthquake_with_popup.png

## Summary

There is no analysis for this project but the results can be viewed on the maps and overlays with popup information.
